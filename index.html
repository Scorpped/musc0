        <p class="Nycolas"> Are you sick of me?
            Would you like to be?
            I'm trying to tell you something
            Something that I already said</p>
        <p class="Nycolas"> You like a pretty boy
            With a pretty voice
            Who is trying to sell you something
            Something that you already have </p>
        <p class="Nycolas"> But if you're too drunk to drive
            And the music is right
            She might let you stay
            But just for the night
            And if she grabs for your hand
            And drags you along
            She might want a kiss
            Before the end of this song </p>
        <p class="Nycolas">Because love can burn like a cigarette
            And leave you alone with nothing
            And leave you alone with nothing </p>
        <p class="Nycolas">While the others talk
            We were listening to lovers rock
            In her bedroom
            In her bedroom </p>
        <p class="Nycolas">And if you start to kiss
            And the record skips
            Flip it over
            And sit a little closer </p>
        <p class="Nycolas">But if you're too drunk to drive
            And the music is right
            She might let you stay
            But just for the night
            And if she grabs for your hand
            And drags you along
            She might want a kiss
            Before the end of this song </p>
        <p class="Nycolas">Because love can burn like a cigarette
            And leave you alone with nothing
            And leave you alone with nothing </p>
        <p class="Nycolas"> Do-do, do-do-do-do-do
            Do-do, do-do-do-do-do
            Do-do, do-do-do-do-do
            Do-do, do-do-do-do-do</p>
        <p class="Nycolas"> Because love can burn like a cigarette
            And leave you alone with nothing
            And leave you alone with nothing </p>
