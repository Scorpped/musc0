<p class="Nycolas-20">My girl Liddy used to always smoke
    Cigarettes when she couldn't sleep
    She'd disappear for an hour and a half
    And when she'd come back she'd brush her teeth</p>
<p class="Nycolas-20">But I could still smell it on her raggedy tee
    And I could taste it on her lips when we kiss
    Poor little Liddy used to always quit
    But she never really quit
    She'd just say she did</p>
<p class="Nycolas-20">Cigarettes, cigarettes out the window (oh-oh)
    Cigarettes, cigarettes out the window (oh-oh)
    Cigarettes, cigarettes out the window (oh-oh)
    Cigarettes, cigarettes out the window (oh-oh)</p>
<p class="Nycolas-20">My girl Liddy used to always smoke
    Cigarettes when she couldn't sleep
    I wonder what she did when she got done
    I guess she'd just flick them out in the street</p>
<p class="Nycolas-20">Poor little Liddy, she wishes it was dark
    But it's never really dark in L.A.
    The light from the billboard always shines
    But it changed twelve times since you went away</p>
<p class="Nycolas-20">Cigarettes, cigarettes out the window (oh-oh)
    Cigarettes, cigarettes out the window (oh-oh)
    Cigarettes, cigarettes out the window (oh-oh)
    Cigarettes, cigarettes out the window (oh-oh)</p>
<p class="Nycolas-20">We'll find moonlit nights strangely empty
    Because when you call my name through them
    There will be no answer
    Rather melodramatic, aren't you?
    We'll find moonlit nights strangely empty
    Because when you call my name through them
    There will be no answer
    You mind if I smoke?</p>
<p class="Nycolas-20">We'll find moonlit nights strangely empty
    Because when you call my name through them
    There will be no answer
    I always smoke in the theater
    We'll find moonlit nights strangely empty
    Because when you call my name through them
    There'll be no answer
    Somehow it enhances the performance</p>
